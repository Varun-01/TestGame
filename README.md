# TestGame
HW-2
Homework 2 for the team members:
1. Branden Nguyen
2. Varun Sura
3. Jesse Hurtado
In this project we have developed a simple running game by applying basic concepts for unity and implemented following tasks:
-- Make camera move (i) behind of object as the object moves (like the cube) and (ii) a top
down view that looks down the whole scene and switch between (i) and (ii) should be
done by key inut
-- Demonstrate that you can add texture and shading effects on the objects in the scene
and change them with button clicks.
-- Demonstrate that your objects can respond to collision (and physics properly) and add
special effects as a consequence of collision.
-- Add particle effects.
-- A button makes a scene transition (so you should make at least 2 scene)
-- A button activates simple character animation
-- A button changes shading effect (day to night scene or something else)
-- Mouse click picks up an object or creates (instantiates) an object in a scene.
Later we used github with unity to combine our individual tasks into one final project.
